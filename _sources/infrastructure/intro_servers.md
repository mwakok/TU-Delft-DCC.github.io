# Remote servers

## About these guides
These guides aim to give you a quick overview of research computing and research computing infrastructure (RCI). After reading these materials you will be to have an overview of how TU Delft can address your computational needs.

## Examples of research computing infrastructure
- [TU Delft HPC](https://login.hpc.tudelft.nl/)
- Virtual machines provided by TU Delft
- National resources like [Cartesius Super Computer](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/cartesius) or [Lisa cluster](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa)

## Why you should care about research computing infrastructure
> Sometimes you just can’t solve your research computing problems with a laptop alone. 
- You’re trying to capture data from an experiment that’s running over several days. 
- Your computer simulation needs more computer memory than you can fit into your laptop. 
- Several members of your group need to use the same software installation.


## Some things to keep in mind
- A remote computer is not a server even though it could be.
- Remote computers can also be Virtual Machines working on actual computers/hardware
- Servers are meant to run continuously and provide a "service" often via http, to "client computers". It implies some understanding of networks, http protocols, and server software.

## Some use cases and examples
1. You might want to run jobs in a remote machine instead of your desktop, specially when the computational task can take a lot of resources. 
1. You might want to run an instance of a service. For example a geoserver, a postgresql database for your lab or research group, others.
1. You need to use a cluster to run simulations or process large data sets.
1. You want to setup a server to host a static website or web application. 

## Basic skills 
- Working with the command line, shell scripting and linux
- Working remotely and securely using ssh
- Transfer files from one computer to another
- Working with containers
