# Continuous Integration with Gitlab

## Background
If you happen to be working with TU Delft Gitlab instance and you want to implement DevOps or CI/CD pipelines, then you need to install a gitlab runner on your own. This should runner should be in a server, responding to changes such as commits or pull requests in your Gitlab repository.  

## Quick overview of how it works
In order to be ready to run CI/CD pipeline, a gitlab-runner Docker container is running on the server all the time. When a new commit is made in the GitLab repository, this triggers the CI/CD process to run a job (e.g., unit test) based on the pipeline defined in the .gitlab-ci.yml file in the repository. The container used to carry out the CI/CD tests is defined in the .gitlab-ci.yml file in the first line, and spawned from within the continuously running gitlab-runner container. In our example, we define `image:python:3.7.3` so every time a commit is made in the repository, a new container based on the python:3.7.3 Docker image is started and used to run tests on the python scripts and generate artifacts as defined in the .gitlab-ci.yml file.

## What this documentation will help achieve
The documentation below will help you deploy GitLab runner in a Docker container on a server to automatically run CI/CD tests and store artifacts every time there is a new commit to a GitLab repository.

## Prerequisites
**Server:** This example uses a server to run the whole process. You can request a server from TU Delft ICT service following these directions [here](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/acryan/data-management-for-researchers/-/wikis/Setting-up-and-running-a-THREDDS-server) . It is useful to set this up on a server so that Docker can be running continuously, and be ready to run CI/CD tests whenever a new commit occurs in the repository.

**Docker:** We use a Docker container to run the Gitlab runner and initialise the CI/CD pipeline. 

**Gitlab runner:** (from GitLab documentation) "Runners are the agents that run the CI/CD jobs that come from GitLab. When you register a runner, you are setting up communication between your GitLab instance and the machine where GitLab Runner is installed. Runners usually process jobs on the same machine where you installed GitLab Runner." [Link](https://doc.gitlab.com)

**GitLab repository:** A remote repository that can store your code and keeps track of your project development. You're on one right now! :) If you haven’t already, you use your netID and password to login to TU Delft’s GitLab instance at gitlab.tudelft.nl and create a repository containing your project code.

**CI/CD pipeline:** “A CI/CD pipeline automates your software delivery process. The pipeline builds code, runs tests (CI), and safely deploys a new version of the application (CD)” [Link](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/cicd-pipeline).

## Tools/Software
* GitLab (TU Delft instance)
* Docker
* gitlab-runner Docker image

## Steps
1. Request the server
2. Connect to the server via ssh
3. Install Docker on the server
4. Pull in the gitlab-runner image
5. Create a unit test function stored as a file in the repository
6. Make the .gitlab-ci.yml file
7. Set up the GitLab runner
8. Deploy the GitLab runner in a Docker container
9. Register the runner
10. Test the CI/CD pipeline 

### Step 1. Request server running Ubuntu
If you don't have a VPS already, you can request one from TU Delft ICT. Instructions for requesting a server and storage from ICT can be found here ___. Ubuntu is associated with Basic Configuration 4 on the TopDesk request form.

### Step 2. Connect to the server via ssh
The email response from Sysadmin@TUDelft.nl confirming the successful deployment of your server should contain instructions to connect via ssh. 

The default login procedure is to connect to the Bastion host (an intermediary server) and then to your server, so it is a two-step process. Please check your email for Steps A and B as described by ICT admin.

You can also connect to your server using Putty (Windows) or, on Mac/Linux, configure one-step access by storing ssh keys between your local machine and your server and designating an alias. Details can be found here ___. 

When you are successfully connected, you should see in your terminal/command prompt something like this:

### Step 3. Install Docker on the server 

Servers often do not come with Docker installed, so you may need to do it by yourself. To check whether Docker is installed, run `docker --version`. If you get an error message, you can install it using the following commands:

`sudo su` (this will give you the root access)
`apt install docker.io`

Now, Docker is installed. You can check if it is installed successfully by again typing `docker --version` in the terminal. The result should show the version of Docker you just installed.

### Step 4. Pull the gitlab-runner Docker image
In order to run CI/CD jobs for your repository, you need to install GitLab Runner. GitLab Runner is an application that works with GitLab CI/CD to run jobs in a pipeline. Rather than install GitLab Runner directly on the server, we will run a lightweight version of it as a Docker container. To do so, we first need to pull the gitlab-runner Docker image by running:

`docker pull gitlab/gitlab-runner`

You can check whether it was successful by running `docker images` - you should see the gitlab/gitlab-runner image listed in the output.

### Step 5. Create a unit test function stored as a file in the repository

### Step 6. Set up the CI by configuration of the .gitlab-ci.yml file

This file in the root of your repository defines what CI/CD tests to run upon each new commit. It does this by prescribing what container to run, what scripts to run inside the container, and what things to store as artefacts.

In the first line of the file, you can write `image: <image_name>:<tag>` to indicate you want to run the runner in a Docker container container.  `<image_name>` should be replaced by the name of the image you want to use to start a container and `<tag>` should be replaced by the tag of the image you want to use(image names can be found on DockerHub). Tag will be set to `latest` by default.

**Important:** The file must be named exactly `.gitlab-ci.yml` so it will be recognizable by GitLab runner. Below is an example .gitlab-ci.yml file. 

```yaml
# This is a sample build configuration for Python.
# Check our guides at https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4UWN for more examples.
# Only use spaces to indent your .yml configuration.
# -----
# You can specify a custom docker image from Docker Hub as your build environment.
image: python:3.7.3

cache:
  paths:
    - .cache/pip
    - venv/

test:
  script: # Modify the commands below to build your repository.
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - nosetests --with-coverage  --cover-html
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - cover/
```


Tags can be added as a final section in your .gitlab-ci.yml file (they are optional, we didn’t enter any in this example). You then need to enter these tags exactly when registering the runner.

### Step 7. Set up GitLab runner  

Now that you have the .gitlab-ci.yml file configured, you can link your repository to a runner with a token and tags, if you have included those in your .gitlab-ci.yml file. The token can be generated in GitLab by going to Your Project -> Settings -> CI/CD -> Expand Runners -> Setup a specific runner manually. Copy the token you see there.

![token](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/acryan/data-management-for-researchers/-/wikis/uploads/89288dcfd011627a4397cf4a4ad00cd7/token.PNG)

### Step 8. Deploy GitLab runner in a Docker container

```bash
docker run -d --name gitlab-runner --restart always \
-v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest
```

**on Mac OS, use /Users/Shared/ instead of /srv/**

Check that gitlab-runner container is running using `docker ps -a`

### Step 9. Register the runner 

Run the following command to register your runner and configure it to deploy in a Docker container on your server.

`docker run --rm -it -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner register`

**on Mac OS, use /Users/Shared/ instead of /srv/**

In response to this command you will be prompted to answer a series of questions, about the gitlab-ci coordinator URL (for TU Delft this is https://gitlab.tudelft.nl), gitlab-ci token (copied from your repository CI/CD settings), an optional description (can hit enter to skip), tgas (must exactly match the tags in your .gitlab-ci.yml file, or hit enter to skip), executor (docker), and default Docker image (same as the one specified in your .gitlab-ci.yml file). 

```
Please enter the gitlab-ci coordinator URL (e.g. https://gitlab.com/):
https://gitlab.tudelft.nl
Please enter the gitlab-ci token for this runner:
<copied from your repository CI/CD settings>
Please enter the gitlab-ci description for this runner: (or hit enter to skip)
Please enter the gitlab-ci tags for this runner (comma separated): (or hit enter to skip)
Please enter the executor: custom, docker-ssh, shell, virtualbox, docker+machine, docker, parallels, ssh, docker-ssh+machine, kubernetes:
docker
Please enter the default Docker image (e.g. ruby:2.6):
python:3.7.3

Runner registered successfully. Feel free to start it, but if it's running already the config should be automatically reloaded! 
```

### Step 10. Check that the CI/CD process is activated and your pipeline runs successfully

In order to activate the CI/CD process, you should make a new commit to the GitLab repository. This will trigger the CI/CD pipeline to run. 

Navigate to Your Project -> CI/CD -> Pipelines to check the status of CI/CD pipelines connected to your repository. If you find a green message that says “passed” with a check mark then congratulations, your pipeline works! If you see a red message that says “failed”, check to see the error message associated with it - sometimes you need to reconfigure your .gitlab-ci.yml file to make sure it uses the correct formatting and defines the tests appropriately.
