# Research computing guides
## About this guide
This guide aims to give you a quick overview of research computing and research computing infrastructure(RCI). After reading these materials you will be to have an overview of how TU Delft can address your computational needs.

## Examples of research computing infrastructure
- [TU Delft HPC](https://login.hpc.tudelft.nl/)
- Virtual machines provided by TU Delft
- National resources like [Cartesius Super Computer](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/cartesius) or [Lisa cluster](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa)

## Why you should care about research computing infrastructure
> Sometimes you just can’t solve your research computing problems with a laptop alone. 
- You’re trying to capture data from an experiment that’s running over several days. 
- Your computer simulation needs more computer memory than you can fit into your laptop. 
- Several members of your group need to use the same software installation.
