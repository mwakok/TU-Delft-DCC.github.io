# Obtaining data
You cannot do any data analysis without even having any data. 
> manual processes of data collection do not scale and that you must learn how to automatically obtain the data you need for a given problem.

**Basic skills required:**
- Basic scripting languages (Python, R, SAS) to consume for instance data provided via APIs or web scraping
- JSON data structure
- Shell scripting
- Querying Relational Databases
- Retrieving Unstructured Data: text, videos, audio files, documents

**Advanced skills**
- Database Management: MySQL, PostgresSQL,MongoDB
- Distributed Storage: Hadoops, Apache Spark/Flink

As a rule of thumb, there are some things you must take into consideration when obtaining your data. You must identify all of your available datasets (which can be from the internet or external/internal databases). You must extract the data into a usable format (.csv, json, xml, etc..)
