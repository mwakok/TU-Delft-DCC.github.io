Although usually digital, research data also includes non-digital formats such as laboratory notebooks and diaries.
## What is research data 
Research data is any information that has been collected, observed, generated or created to validate original research findings.Although usually digital, research data also includes non-digital formats such as laboratory notebooks and diaries.

### Examples of research data
Research data can take many forms. It might be:
- documents, spreadsheets
- laboratory notebooks, field notebooks, diaries
- questionnaires, transcripts, codebooks
- audiotapes, videotapes
- photographs, films
- test responses
- slides, artefacts, specimens, samples
- collections of digital outputs
- data files
- database contents (video, audio, text, images)
- models, algorithms, scripts
- contents of an application (input, output, logfiles for analysis software, simulation software, schemas)
- methodologies and workflows
- standard operating procedures and protocols
- Non-digital data
- Non-digital data such as laboratory notebooks, ice-core samples and sketchbooks is often unique. You should - assess the long-term value of any non-digital data and plan how you will describe and retain them.

## Why manage your research data
Good data management practice:
- increases transparency
- makes your data accessible
- saves you time when writing up
- reduces the risk of data loss
- facilitates future reuse and sharing improves citations

## Who does research data ?
**Mostly research groups leaded by principal investigator or lead researchers**

The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for data management during the research project. 

They will create and implement the data management plan and deposit the data in the University repository once the project has finished. The whole project team should support the PI, and engage in data management activities throughout. The University will provide support and infrastructure.

### The data manager(DM) role
Expertise in data management can come handy when data management is complex. There might be cases where requires a lot of storage and careful planning, a data manager  
 

How a data manager can help you
Set up a workflow for responsible data management for a research project;
Help getting data ready for publishing;
Cleaning, formatting, versioning;
Uploading data and safe guarding data.

### The data stewards(DS) role
A data steward is an oversight or data governance role within an organization, and is responsible for ensuring the quality and fitness for purpose of the organization's data assets, including the metadata for those data assets. A data steward may share some responsibilities with a data custodian, such as the awareness, accessibility, release, appropriate use, security and management of data. A data steward would also participate in the development and implementation of data assets. A data steward may seek to improve the quality and fitness for purpose of other data assets their organization depends upon but is not responsible for.
