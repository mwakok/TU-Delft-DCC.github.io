# Welcome to the DCC Guides!
The (TU Delft) DCC guides aims to provide a low threshold and comprehensive entrypoint to get you started with Research Computing, Research Data and Research Software at TU Delft. 

```{note}
The content in these guides is a compilation of relevant resources, and documents produced by colleagues inside and outside TU Delft. Many of it is borrowed, sometimes remixed. This is not an official TU Delft website, but rather a place where we keep note of things we find important and useful to share.
```

**The guides are split into three main topics:**
Computing, data and software

**We also provide guidance on how to:**
- [Get support from the DCC](./04_About/04_About_DCC.html#how-we-work-and-support-our-community)
- [Participate and contribute to address issues you and other colleagues might have with regard to Computing, Data and Software](https://github.com/TU-Delft-DCC/TU-Delft-DCC.github.io/discussions/1)

**Our mission is to provide hands on knowledge transfer, support and contributions that enable research with better data and software practices**.
In order for us to help you and others we work towards more:
- Openness
- FAIR data
- Open source research software
- Collaboration and community driven progress
