# Data storage facilities at TU Delft 

Storing your data in a secure location is a key element of a successful project with a data component. TU Delft recommends using a [Project Drive]((https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=846ebb16181c43b5836c063a917dd199&from=03aa10b9-c5aa-4e0a-80b1-28ee7ab383df)) for storing research data. This solution enables secure data storage and facilitates access to your data to other researchers from your research group during the duration of the project. It also allows TU Delft researchers to have access to the data after your PhD contract is completed. To find out more on how to request the Project Drive for your project please see this link.
