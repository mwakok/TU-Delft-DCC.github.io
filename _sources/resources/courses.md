# Courses and workshops

## Training for researchers at the TU Delft
The TU Delft organises courses for researchers on data management, research software development, and open science. For an overview of available courses, please visit the [website](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers).


### The Carpentries
The Carpentries teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. All members of the DCC are involved as certified instructors for the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/).

### Code Refinery
[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) acts as a hub for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) software practices. It currently focuses mostly on the Nordic/Baltic countries, but invites collaboratio with the TU Delft as well. CodeRefinery aims to operate as a community project with support from academic organizations. TU Delft researchers can sign up through the [TU Delft library](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers).

### eScience Center
The eScience Center offers has open-source [training materials](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/training-materials/) available and offers regular [workshops](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/digital-skills/).

### SURF
SURF offers various [workshops](https://www.surf.nl/en/training-courses-for-research) for researchers. Please learn more about upcoming workshops through their [event agenda](https://www.surf.nl/en/agenda/research-and-ict).


## Software Sustainability Institute
Since 2010, the Software Sustainability Institute has facilitated the advancement of software in research by cultivating better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (“Better software, better research”). The Institute is based at the Universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and Southampton, and draws on a team of experts with a breadth of experience in software development, project and programme management, research facilitation, publicity and community engagement.

You can view their upcoming workshops at https://www.software.ac.uk/news.

## DCC project workshops

As part of the support it provides, the DCC also develops tailor-made workshops to address specific needs of researchers not covered by general workshop materials. We always aim to have our workshops publicaly available. 

### Python Essentials for GIS Learners

_This 3-day long workshop is for beginners with zero programming experience. We are going to work with very simple geospatial datasets as examples, but it is not exclusive or focused only on GIS. By the end of this workshop, you will learn fundamental concepts of programming with python, version control, and how to work with the command line. We will also demonstrate how these tools are useful and make sense in the context of GIS. We hope to get you inspired and motivated to use these tools in your future research!_
